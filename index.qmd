# Preface {.unnumbered}

Vector control constitutes a major component of malaria control and elimination strategies. WHO recommends using insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and/ or indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria vector control in most areas at risk of malaria as appropriate. These interventions may be supplemented by other interventions such as larval source management (LSM) depending on the setting and available resources.

In the first module, we will discuss the main vector control interventions, i.e., LLIN and IRS, in more detail. The second module deals with data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) program.
