# Preface {.unnumbered}

Vector control constitutes a major component of malaria control and elimination strategies. WHO recommends using insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and/ or indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria vector control in most areas at risk of malaria as appropriate. These interventions may be supplemented by other interventions such as larval source management (LSM) depending on the setting and available resources. While LLINs and IRS target the adult mosquito vector, LSM targets the immature, aquatic stages of the mosquito (the larvae and pupae), thus diminishing the abundance of adult vectors. In this document, we will discuss the main vector control interventions, i.e., LLIN and IRS, in more details.
